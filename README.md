# GPPS CFD Workshop Dataset - TUDa-GLR-OpenStage
This repository hosts the GPPS CFD Workshop submission data for the TUDa-GLR-OpenStage test case. For a comprehensive description of the test case, please go to:
- [[1](#exp1)] test case and the mean flow measurement data;
- [[2](#exp2)] unsteady measurement data;
- [[3](#cfd1)] statistical analysis of the first and the second workshop submissions (i.e., RANS prediction uncertainty bands);
- [[4](#cfd2)] official grid released in the 1st workshop;
- [[5](#cfd3)] official grid released in the 2nd workshop (fixed the geometric error of rotor pinch)

The digitized geometry, grids and measurement data can be found from [GPPS data set](https://gpps.global/gpps-data-sets-2021/) or by emailing [Fabian Klausmann](klausmann@glr.tu-darmstadt.de). (will be included in the repo in future updates)

At the moment, the presentation slides and the submission data of the 4th workshop have been uploaded. Data obtained from previous workshops will be released in future updates.
