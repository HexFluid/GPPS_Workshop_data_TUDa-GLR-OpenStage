1. Turbostream is a commercial flow solver, which solves the three-dimensional URANS equations in a cylindrical coordinate system for turbomachinery. 
2. N100 and N65 represent the simulation based upon 100% and 65% design speed, respectively.
3. Three grids with different nodes number are simulated.
