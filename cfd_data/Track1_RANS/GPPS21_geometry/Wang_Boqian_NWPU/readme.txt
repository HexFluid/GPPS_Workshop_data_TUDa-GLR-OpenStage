1. TurboXD is a in-house flow solver, which solves the three-dimensional URANS equations in a cylindrical coordinate system for turbomachinery. 
2. N100 and N65 represent the simulation based upon 100% and 65% design speed, respectively.
3. MP and STG represent the mixing plane method and the space-time gradient method, respectively.
The space-time gradient method is an efficient reduced order method for analyzing blade row interaction unsteady flow.
Only one operating point (peak efficiency point) was calculated at 65% design speed with the STG method.
