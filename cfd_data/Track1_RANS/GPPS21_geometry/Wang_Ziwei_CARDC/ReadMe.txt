1、Folder "ASPAC_SA_medium_nut0p009" contains the original data, which used nu_t/nu = 0.009 at the inlet for SA model.
   Folder "ASPAC_SA_medium_nut35" contains the new data, which used nu_t/nu = 35 at the inlet for SA model.
2、The data in ASPAC_SA_medium_nut0p009/characteristics.csv is obtained with the 
   same computational conditions(B.C., numerical scheme and so on, except for the inlet condition for SA model)
   as the first 12 lines of data in ASPAC_SA_medium_nut35/characteristics.csv
3、Mass flow rate for Peak efficiency condition and Near stall condition with nut0p009 are 15.999Kg/s and 14.779Kg/s respectively.
   Under the inlet condition with  nu_t/nu=35, it becomes 15.979Kg/s 14.846Kg/s.
   To be compared with HADES(NS, 14.65Kg/s), the working condition with 14.665Kg/s(with nu_t/nu=35) is marked as the NS condition.
   The working condition with 15.979Kg/s(with nu_t/nu=35) is marked as the PE condition.
