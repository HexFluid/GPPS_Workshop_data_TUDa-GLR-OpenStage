Please note that the first point has been computed using static pressure at the outlet and the profile of the point  MFR=16.213 at the inlet
All other points are computed with the profile of total pressure available in the data for each of the operating point
The corrected mass flow has been corrected using the Area Average quantities, whereas in the solver the quantities are imposed as mass flow averaged
